title: Data cleaning by removing headers and trailers (SORTHT)
---
In our data processing system, it is essential to ensure that output files contain only the necessary data. This document describes the SORTHT job, which focuses on cleaning data files by using the ICETOOL utility to remove headers and trailers from the input file. The job processes the input file and outputs a cleaned file, free of extraneous header and trailer records.

For example, if the input file contains metadata at the beginning and end, the SORTHT job will strip these out, leaving only the core data in the output file.
