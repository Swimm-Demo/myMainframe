title: Comparing PDS Libraries (SUPERC)
---
This document describes the process of identifying differences between two PDS libraries using the COMPARE job (SUPERC). The job reads the old and new PDS libraries and utilizes the ISRSUPC utility to list the differences. The output is displayed in the spool.

For example, if there are changes in the members of the PDS libraries, the job will highlight these differences in the spool output.
