title: Decompressing and Restoring Data (DECOMPRESS)
---
This document describes the DECOMPRESS job, which is responsible for decompressing and restoring data files from a compressed format to their original state. The job reads the compressed file and restores its contents to the specified output dataset. The input for this job is a compressed file, and the output is the restored data in its original format.

For example, if a file was compressed using the ADRDSSU program, this job will take that compressed file and restore it to its original state, making the data accessible again.
