title: Comparing files and segregating matched and unmatched records (COMPARE)
---
This document describes the COMPARE job, which is responsible for comparing two input files and creating separate output files for matched and unmatched records. The program reads the input files, compares their contents, and then segregates the records accordingly. The input files are specified, and the output consists of two files: one for matched records and another for unmatched records.

For example, if the input files contain records of customer transactions, the COMPARE job will identify which transactions are present in both files and which are not, outputting them into the respective matched and unmatched files.
