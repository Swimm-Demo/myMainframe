title: Binding DB2 Package (BIND)
---
This document describes the process of binding a DB2 package to a program using the BIND job. The BIND job reads the DBRM library and binds the package to the specified DB2 subsystem, schema, and owner. This ensures that the program can interact with the DB2 database efficiently.

For example, if you need to bind a package for a new program, you would specify the DBRM library, DB2 subsystem, schema, and owner in the BIND job to complete the binding process.
