title: Exporting Table Data (UNLOAD)
---
This document describes the process of exporting data from a specific DB2 table to a file. The job utilizes the IKJEFT01 utility to execute the DSNTIUAL program, which runs an SQL SELECT statement to unload the table data into the specified output files. The input for this process is the DB2 table, and the output is the unloaded data file.

For example, if you need to export data from the 'EMPLOYEES' table, this job will create a file containing all the records from that table.
