title: Compressing multiple files (GETUDATA)
---
This document describes the process of compressing multiple files into one archive using the COMPRESS job (GETUDATA). The program reads a list of specified files and creates a new compressed file containing all these files. This is useful for consolidating multiple datasets into a single, manageable file.

For example, if you have several log files that need to be archived, this job will take those files as input and produce a single compressed file as output.
