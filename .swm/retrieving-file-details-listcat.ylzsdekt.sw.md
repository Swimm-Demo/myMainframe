This document explains the process of retrieving detailed information about a specific file using the IDCAMS utility. The LISTCAT job lists catalog entries, including volume and allocation details, for the specified file. This is achieved through the execution of the `STEP010` step, which runs the IDCAMS program to gather and display the necessary file details.

For example, if you need to find out the volume and allocation details of a file named 'filename', the LISTCAT job will provide this information.
