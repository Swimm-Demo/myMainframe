title: Renaming Files (RENAME)
---
This document describes the process of renaming files, including VSAM, PS, and PDS files, within a mainframe system. The renaming is achieved using the IDCAMS utility, which is executed in the `STEP010` section of the job. The input for this process is the old file name, and the output is the file with the new name.

For example, if you need to rename a file named `OLD.FILE.NAME` to `NEW.FILE.NAME`, this job will handle the renaming process.
